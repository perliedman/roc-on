# ROC ON

This is a tiny web app to help monitoring Radio Online Controls (ROCs) for orienteering. It's basically a front-end for [https://roc.olresultat.se/](https://roc.olresultat.se/), the main ROC site developed and maintained by Oskar Berg and Erik Berg; most credit for backend etc. goes to them. I find the original web UI a bit gnarly, so I made this thing, feel free to use it.

The webapp is deployed on [roc-on.vercel.app](https://roc-on.vercel.app/).
